Buffer detailed info: Buffer object IndexBuffer (bound to GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER_ARB, usage hint is GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW) will use VIDEO memory as the source for buffer object operations.
Buffer detailed info: Buffer object VertexBuffer (bound to GL_VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_BUFFER_BINDING_ARB (0), GL_VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_BUFFER_BINDING_ARB (1), GL_VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_BUFFER_BINDING_ARB (2), and GL_ARRAY_BUFFER_ARB, usage hint is GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW) will use VIDEO memory as the source for buffer object operations.
Buffer detailed info: Based on the usage hint and actual usage, buffer object IndexBuffer (bound to GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER_ARB, usage hint is GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW) will be configured as STREAM.
